 
 # Welcome to my "randomscripts " repo

You've stumbled upon a collection of scripts and configurations that are about as organized as a junk drawer in a busy kitchen, but don't worry, each of these assorted goodies has a specific purpose and a story to tell. A symphony of code, if you will, each playing their part in the grand scheme of things.

Remember, this is a no-judgement zone. We've all written code at 3 AM that somehow "just works" and seemed to be a good idea at the time.

### 50unattended-upgrades for debian and ubuntu
This is where the magic happens. Or, more accurately, this is where the mundane, repetitive, "I'm too busy for this" kind of magic happens. It's all about the upgrades you never knew you needed, until you did. As of July 21, 2023, this script has been fine-tuned, polished, and given a new lease on life.

### AutoSetupAD.ps1 for windows
Ever get tired of setting up Active Directories? Yeah, us too. That's why we improved this PowerShell script at 12:06 PM on July 21, 2023. No need to thank us, your sanity is thanks enough.

### Limit_SSH-logins_using_GeoIP.md
This markdown file is a guide to limiting SSH logins using GeoIP, because sometimes you just want to keep certain parts of the world at arm's length. Created on August 8, 2018. It's like a bouncer for your server.

### add-users.csv help automate test user creation
This CSV file is where we keep the list of users. It's like a party guest list, but with less confetti and more password complexity requirements 

### bash-multiline-comments.sh
A bash script that's all about those multi-line comments. Think of it as a soapbox for your code. Created before the war

### And Many More...
The list goes on, with scripts to clean up your download directory (`cleanupdownloaddir`), create swap files on Debian (`createswapondebian.sh`), and even a script to block ads on a Fortinet FortiGate (`fortinet-fortigate-block-ads`).

## Summary
This repository is a collection of scripts and files that each serve a unique purpose. While some may seem random, somehow have their place. They're the tools in the toolbox, the ingredients in the kitchen, the... well, you get the idea. Explore, use, and improve upon them as you see fit.
