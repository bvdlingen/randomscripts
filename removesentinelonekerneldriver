# Boot your Mac directly in Recovery OS

# In Recovery OS, chroot to your system volume. 
# May also need to unlock it first.
# this example assumes your volume label is "Macintosh HD"
# make sure the disk is mounted, will not be mounted automatically if disk encryption is used (which you should have)

# run the following commands:

chroot /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/


rm -rf /Library/Extensions/Sentinel.kext
