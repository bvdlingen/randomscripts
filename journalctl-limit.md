# "Linux Journald log cleanup - Let's Make Some Space!"

Time to deal with those pesky journald logs on Linux - those clingy troublemakers, like the old but common syslog's pesky little siblings.


1. `sudo journalctl --disk-usage`

This one's for you to know how much those logs are hogging your precious disk space. Watch out, they can get quite clingy!

2. `sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1month`

Now, we're getting down to business! This command cleans up those old entries like Marie Kondo tidying up a messy closet. Anything older than a month? Sayonara!

3. `sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1month`

Oh look, it's the same as the one before! Let's recycle commands like a true eco-warrior, shall we?

So, clean up those logs and make room for more important stuff. Happy Linux-ing!
